[00:00.45] When I see you again
[00:06.53] Will it be the same
[00:12.45] When I see you again
[00:18.34] Will it be over
[00:24.30] When I see you again
[00:29.16] Will your great eyes still say
[00:44.16] 
[00:35.38] What's the matter, baby
[00:39.51] What's the matter, baby
[00:42.38] What's the matter, baby, baby, baby
[00:47.75] What's the matter, baby
[00:51.81] What's the matter, baby
[00:53.63] What's the matter, baby, baby
[01:08.13] 
[01:00.21] So she walks slowly down the hall
[01:05.77] There are many doors in the hallway
[01:12.69] And she stares at the stairs
[01:17.39] Ooh there are many things to stare at these days
[01:24.59] If she sees him again
[01:30.82] Will your very best friend
[01:35.43] Will your very best friend
[01:40.28] Oh, have been replaced by some other
[01:58.28] 
[01:49.55] What's the matter, baby
[01:51.74] What's the matter, baby
[01:53.90] What's the matter, baby, baby, baby
[02:01.59] What's the matter, baby
[02:04.42] What's the matter, baby
[02:06.48] What's the matter, baby, baby
[02:20.98] 
[02:12.75] And the dream says I want you
[02:19.23] And the dream is gone
[02:23.71] So she stays up night on end
[02:30.93] Well at least there is a dream left
[02:48.43] 
[02:36.99] If I see you again
[02:42.27] Will it be over
[02:48.65] If I see you again
[02:53.74] Will it be the same
[03:00.81] If I see you again
[03:06.05] Will it be over
[03:13.40] Again and again
[03:18.08] Over and over
