Life can be just like painting
Full of wonderful strangeness
With colors so vibrant you feel like you should look away
Paint me in your dreams you'll remember me this way

I, I want to life you out of your past
Because I had nothing to do with it say we can leave it behind
My face reflected in your eyes for everyone to see

Until I see you again
Until I see you again

I amazed all the survivors
With my heart strings intact I brought it all back to you
And I, I want to dance with you
I need you to enjoy just the thought of it, give in, give in
Oh walk me through your maze, I promise I won't stray

Until I see you again
Until I see you again

Walk me through your maze forever...
Until I see you again
