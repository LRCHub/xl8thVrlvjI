Cause I, I'd give it all away
If it meant that I could see you again
The nights alone have made me see
You're the missing puzzle piece
I'd give it all away
If I could see you again
If I could see you again

Mistakes, a twisted game we played
And I won't forget if I see you again
You think you made your move on me
Now I'm broken, can't you see?
It'll be the same if I see you again
If I could see you again

Cause I, I'd give it all away
If it meant that I could see you again
The nights alone have made me see
You're the missing puzzle piece
I'd give it all away
If I could see you again
If I could see you again
