CHORUS (Charlie Puth)
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again
When I see you again
VERSE 1 (Wiz Khalifa)
Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
About another path
I know we love to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different
See the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
PRE-HOOK (Wiz Khalifa)
How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got
Everything I would do you were standing
there by my side
And now you gon be with me for the last ride
CHORUS
VERSE 2 (Wiz Khalifa)
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And where brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone
PRE-HOOK
BRIDGE (Charlie Puth)
So let the light guide your way
Yeah hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
will always lead you home
CHORUS
